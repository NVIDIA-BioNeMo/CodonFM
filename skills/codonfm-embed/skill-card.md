## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and bioinformatics researchers who need to extract frozen CLS embeddings from Encodon checkpoints for coding-sequence property modeling such as translation efficiency, expression, and mRNA stability. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
2 evaluation tasks (2 positive), 3 attempts per task, each in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Verifies final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the expected skill was selected, decoys avoided, and workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Equal-weight mean of goal completion (goal_accuracy) and expected workflow adherence (behavior_check). <br>
- Efficiency: 50% tool-call productivity and 50% token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected and the workflow executed. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>
