## Description: <br>
Fine-tune public CodonFM Encodon checkpoints on labeled coding-sequence or coding-variant data using LoRA, head-only, or full fine-tuning. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and computational biologists fine-tune CodonFM Encodon checkpoints on labeled coding-sequence or variant data for sequence-level regression or classification. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Not Specified] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [None identified] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-8`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-5.5`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
Evaluated against 3 internal evaluation tasks (3 positive) across 2 agents, each attempt in an isolated sandbox pod. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Checks for unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Equal-weight mean of goal completion and expected workflow adherence. <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? 50% tool-call productivity and 50% token efficiency. <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool-call productivity (routing scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Actual uncached prompt plus completion token usage. <br>

| Overall | 89.9% | 87.9% |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 pts) | 33.3% → 66.7% (+33.4 pts) |
| Correctness | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 pts) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 pts) |
| Discoverability | 87.7% | 91.0% |
| Effectiveness | 83.3% → 80.0% (-3.3 pts) | 86.7% → 93.3% (+6.6 pts) |
| Efficiency | 82.0% | 88.5% |
